## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS
- Next.js
- TypeScript

### What I Learned

This webiste project is built with Nextjs and Typescript. For this challenge I try to explore interface on Typescript. It was to make sure the type of each data is appropriate.

```ts
interface TopStories {
  id: number;
  number: string;
  img: StaticImageData;
  name: string;
  content: string;
}
```
